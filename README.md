# Link Prediction in Social Networks
Social and Information Networks Project

### Introduction
Link Prediction is a fundamental problem in Social Network Analysis. The
objective behind link prediction is to identify pairs of nodes that will either form a
link or not in the future. There are numerous real-life applications which link
prediction solves and it can range from predicting which customers are likely to
buy what products on Amazon, recommending movies to watch on Netflix,
suggesting interactions between children or even employees and on a farther end
extracting vital insights from global networks. There are numerous techniques for
link prediction such as Node-based metric, Topology-based metrics;which is
commonly used, Social Theory based metrics and Learning based methods.
In our project, we aim to use the given dataset, to train our models after which we
will use a testing dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. We will also
use a wide range of models and methods to determine the best possible solution to
get more accurate results.
